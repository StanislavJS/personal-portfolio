# My Favorite Free Tools for Web Development

There are many free tools out there that help me learn and write better code. Here are some of my favorites:

## Tools I Use All the Time

- **CodePen** – for testing small HTML/CSS/JS snippets
- **GitHub** – to store and share my code
- **Figma** – for creating simple UI ideas
- **MDN Web Docs** – the best place to learn web standards
- **FreeCodeCamp** – for practice and projects

## Bonus Tip

Don’t get stuck picking the “perfect” tool. Try things, see what works, and focus on learning.
