# How I Stay Motivated While Learning to Code

Learning to code can be exciting, but sometimes it’s also hard. Some days I feel stuck or tired. But I’ve found ways to stay motivated and keep learning.

## What Helps Me Stay on Track

- Setting small goals
- Celebrating every little success
- Taking breaks when I feel tired
- Watching inspiring YouTube videos or developer stories

## I Also Remind Myself:

> "It’s okay to not know everything today. I’m learning, and that takes time."

## Final Thoughts

If you’re also learning to code, don’t give up. Just keep going, even if it’s one step at a time. You’re doing great!
