# My Journey in Learning Web Development

I started learning **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. At first, it was confusing, but step by step I understood more and more.

What helped me most:

- Watching tutorials
- Practicing a lot
- Reading documentation
- Asking for help when stuck

Key lessons I learned:

- Mistakes are normal
- Practice makes progress
- Clean code matters

Now I’m learning **React** and **Node.js**, and I feel excited to keep growing as a developer.
